Simple React Native application demonstrating the usage of Embed.

## Usage

Before launching the example application, run `yarn` from the project's root to install all the required dependencies.

Make sure `GR4VY_ID` and `TOKEN` are set in the `.env` file (you can copy `.env.example` and update accordingly).

Running `yarn ios` or `yarn android` from the package folder will start the app on either an iOS or Android simulator.
